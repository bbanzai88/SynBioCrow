# SynBioCrow
SynBioCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive synthetic biology tasks. It is based in part on the ChemCrow project. Please see the following paper: Bran, Andres M., et al. "ChemCrow: Augmenting large-language models with chemistry tools." arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05376 (2023).

Built with Langchain, it uses a collection of chemical and synthetic biology tools including RDKit, paper-qa, Galaxy-SynBioCAD pipeline for synthetic biology design and engineering, and others.
