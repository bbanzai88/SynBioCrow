# SynBioCrow
SynBioCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive synthetic biology tasks. It is based conceptually on the ChemCrow project. Please see the following paper: Bran, Andres M., et al. "ChemCrow: Augmenting large-language models with chemistry tools." arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05376 (2023).

Built with Langchain, it uses a collection of chemical and synthetic biology tools including RDKit, paper-qa, Galaxy-SynBioCAD pipeline for synthetic biology design and engineering, and others. Ultimately, the  goal is to  expand it into a Design Build Test and Learn (DBTL) tool that can take a desired compound, identify the  best pathway(s) and give the design for a cassette of sequence that can be ordered and inserted into the chassis of choice (Saccharomyces or Ecoli, to  start).   From  there the the design can be tested and improved (Hence the  learn part). For the  design part, we will be using open source bioretrosynthesis programs. Bioretrosynthesis is a bit different from classical organic retrosynthesis. It’s the process of designing metabolic pathways backwards from a target compound to simpler precursors that enzymes or microbes can produce. The literature usually describes three main approaches:

1. Template-Based (Rule-Based) Bioretrosynthesis

Uses manually curated reaction rules or templates derived from known enzyme chemistry.
Each step in the pathway is generated by applying a “generalized” enzyme transformation rule (e.g., alcohol → aldehyde, ketone → alcohol).
Tools: RetroPath, BNICE.ch, PathPred.
Strengths: Interpretable, grounded in biochemistry.
Limitations: Can miss novel or atypical transformations outside the rule set.

2. Similarity- or Homology-Based (Enzyme/Reaction Database–Driven)

Searches for reactions by finding enzymes or substrates similar to the target molecule in biochemical databases (KEGG, MetaCyc, BRENDA).
Works by structural similarity (substrates/products) or sequence similarity (enzymes).
Tools: PathPred (KEGG), MetaCyc / BioCyc / RouteSearch, ATLAS of Biochemistry (ATLASx), BRENDA, Selenzyme → 
Strengths: Connects to real enzymes quickly.
Limitations: Biased toward known reactions; limited novelty.

3. Machine Learning / Data-Driven Bioretrosynthesis

Uses statistical, ML, or neural models trained on large biochemical reaction datasets to predict possible disconnections.
Can generalize beyond known rules by learning patterns of enzymatic transformations.
Tools: DeepPath, RetroBioCat (hybrid ML + rules), BioNavi-NP.
Strengths: Can discover novel, non-obvious routes.
Limitations: Dependent on data quality; interpretability may be low.

✅ So in summary:

Rule/template-based (hand-crafted biotransformation rules)
Similarity-based (find close known enzymes/reactions)
ML/data-driven (predict transformations with models)
