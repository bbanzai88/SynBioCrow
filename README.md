# SynBioCrow
SynBioCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive synthetic biology tasks. It is based conceptually on the ChemCrow project. Please see the following paper: Bran, Andres M., et al. "ChemCrow: Augmenting large-language models with chemistry tools." arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05376 (2023).

This system as it now stands is an automated end-to-end bio-retrosynthesis and design platform that integrates multiple computational tools into a unified LangGraph-based workflow. It identifies, evaluates, and simulates novel enzymatic pathways for the biosynthesis of target molecules, combining retrosynthetic search, enzyme selection, thermodynamic filtering, and metabolic simulation.

Key Capabilities:

Automated Retrosynthesis (RetroBioCat2)
Generates de novo biochemical pathways from a target molecule’s SMILES.
Performs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over reaction rules to explore feasible routes.
Pathway Extraction & Annotation
Converts retrosynthesis outputs into structured reaction tables (substrates, products, scores).
Integrates similarity metrics, prior precedents, and enzyme reaction type metadata.
Thermodynamic & Ranking Modules
Uses dGPredictor / eQuilibrator to estimate Gibbs free energies (ΔG′).
Ranks pathways based on combined heuristic and thermodynamic feasibility scores.
Enzyme Identification (Selenzyme)
Predicts candidate enzymes for each step, optionally scraping Selenzyme for activity and organism data.
Metabolic Simulation (COBRApy / novoStoic)
Constructs toy stoichiometric models for top-ranked pathways.
Runs flux balance analysis (FBA) to estimate steady-state feasibility and pathway yield.
Sequence Ranking + Design of Experiments (DoE)
Build / Approval / Export Workflow
Produces pathway briefs, annotated CSVs/JSONs, simulation flux tables, and an export manifest for downstream integration or lab validation.

Technical Architecture

LangGraph orchestration: modular “nodes” for each stage (retrosynthesis, extract, thermo, rank, simulate, selenzyme, seqrank, doe, build, approve, export).
Micromamba-based environment isolation ensures reproducible dependency management per run.
Streaming execution & checkpointed state allow resuming or extending pipelines dynamically.
Output artifacts (CSV, JSON, Markdown) capture every stage for transparency and reproducibility.

Built with Langchain, it uses a collection of open source chemical and synthetic biology tools. Ultimately, the  goal is to futher expand it into a Design Build Test and Learn (DBTL) tool that can take a desired compound, identify the  best pathway(s) and give the design for a cassette of sequence that can be ordered and inserted into the chassis of choice (Saccharomyces or Ecoli, to  start).   From  there the the design can be tested and improved (hence the testing and learning parts). For the  design part (once we get everything  else working), we will be using multiple open source bioretrosynthesis programs. Bioretrosynthesis is a bit different from classical organic retrosynthesis. It’s the process of designing metabolic pathways backwards from a target compound to simpler precursors that enzymes or microbes can produce. The literature usually describes three main approaches:

1. Template-Based (Rule-Based) Bioretrosynthesis

Uses manually curated reaction rules or templates derived from known enzyme chemistry.
Each step in the pathway is generated by applying a “generalized” enzyme transformation rule (e.g., alcohol → aldehyde, ketone → alcohol).
Tools: RetroPath, BNICE.ch, PathPred.
Strengths: Interpretable, grounded in biochemistry.
Limitations: Can miss novel or atypical transformations outside the rule set.

2. Similarity- or Homology-Based (Enzyme/Reaction Database–Driven)

Searches for reactions by finding enzymes or substrates similar to the target molecule in biochemical databases (KEGG, MetaCyc, BRENDA).
Works by structural similarity (substrates/products) or sequence similarity (enzymes).
Tools: PathPred (KEGG), MetaCyc / BioCyc / RouteSearch, ATLAS of Biochemistry (ATLASx), BRENDA, Selenzyme → 
Strengths: Connects to real enzymes quickly.
Limitations: Biased toward known reactions; limited novelty.

3. Machine Learning / Data-Driven Bioretrosynthesis

Uses statistical, ML, or neural models trained on large biochemical reaction datasets to predict possible disconnections.
Can generalize beyond known rules by learning patterns of enzymatic transformations.
Tools: DeepPath, RetroBioCat2 (hybrid ML + rules), BioNavi-NP.
Strengths: Can discover novel, non-obvious routes.
Limitations: Dependent on data quality; interpretability may be low.

✅ So in summary:

Rule/template-based (hand-crafted biotransformation rules)
Similarity-based (find close known enzymes/reactions)
ML/data-driven (predict transformations with models) 

The current plan is to use all three approaches to ensure (as much as possible) getting coverage for many, if not all potential desired compounds. Other approaches that may get explored include:
(1) Using an ensemble retrosynthesis approach to identify the best possible pathway (syntheus or chemeric?) and somehow convert to a retrobiosyntheis approach using perhaps a hybrid non-enzymatic and regular chemistry approach ..
(2) Use an approach utilizing enzyme design..
